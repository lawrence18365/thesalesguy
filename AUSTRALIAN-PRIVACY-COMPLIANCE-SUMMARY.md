## 🆘 Common Questions

### Q: Do I need a cookie banner in Australia?
**A:** No, Australia doesn't mandate GDPR-style cookie banners. However, you must be transparent in your privacy policy (which you now are).

### Q: What if I get EU/UK visitors?
**A:** If you expect significant EU/UK traffic or target those markets, add a consent banner that controls GTM tag firing. Your privacy policy is already comprehensive enough for GDPR, you'd just need the banner UI.

### Q: Can I start running Facebook ads now?
**A:** Yes, once you install Meta Pixel in GTM (follow the guide). Your privacy policy already discloses it.

### Q: Is the privacy policy compliant without Meta Pixel installed?
**A:** Yes! The policy discloses Meta Pixel even though it's not installed yet. When you install it, you're already covered.

### Q: What about Google Analytics - is that compliant?
**A:** Yes, GA4 is already installed and properly disclosed in the privacy policy with opt-out mechanisms.
