<p>It is so easy to get information paralysis on here.</p>

                <p>Everyone is talking down different methods of outreach to push an agenda. "Cold calling is dead." "Email automation is king." "If you aren't on LinkedIn, you don't exist."</p>

                <p>All this information leaves business owners and leaders confused on the best method. Is it call, email, LinkedIn, door knocking or all of it?</p>

                <p>I don't send many marketing emails or LinkedIn messages. I make a lot of calls. I always have done. So that's what I help my clients with. My expertise is proven, and I stick to it.</p>

                <p>This is why I focus on teaching skills, not just selling services. It's about giving people the tools to win, not just for one campaign, but forever.</p>

                <h2>From LinkedIn Failure to a High Value Deal</h2>

                <p>A few weeks back I was approached by a business owner. They wanted to enter a new industry and didn't know the best way to tackle it.</p>

                <p>They'd tried LinkedIn messaging with no avail. They were confused and had no structure.</p>

                <p>The interesting part? They were comfortable on the phone, but had not much experience cold calling. This is a perfect scenario. The engine was there, it just needed a steering wheel.</p>

                <p>We spent 6 hours together. We learnt the basics. We built a custom script that lands. We trained on common objections. We drilled the process until it felt natural.</p>

                <p>This week, my client made a cold call. They were hit with the classic 'send me an email.'</p>

                <p>They handled the objection with ease, using the exact framework we practiced. They booked a meeting.</p>

                <p>As of today, they are in the final stages of finalising a deal.</p>

                <h2>Why the Call Won</h2>

                <p>This is the most important part of the story.</p>

                <p>The prospect hadn't had a cold call offering his service before. Competitors had emailed, though.</p>

                <p>Think about that. The prospect's inbox was full of competitors. But the phone was silent. It was the caller, the one who chose the direct and human path, who was the winner.</p>

                <p>The one who learned not to beg, but to engage. This is the new standard, as we've discussed before in <a href="/blog/stop-begging-for-meetings/">Stop Begging for Meetings: The 2026 Cold Call Power Flip</a>.</p>

                <h2>The Skill That Lasts Forever</h2>

                <p>As much as I love the freedom of working for myself and everything that comes with it, I love seeing clients win.</p>

                <p>This one deal will be worth a lot more than I charged them.</p>

                <p>And it's a skill they now have forever. They know how to pick up the phone, create an opportunity from nothing, and see it through to a close. They've learned to stop wasting time on unqualified leads, a core principle for a better work life balance in <a href="/blog/always-on-sales-myth/">The 'Always On' Sales Myth: Stop Working Harder</a>.</p>

                <p>Cold calling isn't dead.</p>

                <p>It isn't dying.</p>

                <p>And it never ever will.</p>
