<p>If I was running an SDR team today I never would celebrate "meetings booked."</p>

                <p>Especially via cold call.</p>

                <p>Yes meetings matter.</p>

                <p>But it is not hard to book a meeting or put a placeholder in a prospect's diary.</p>

                <p>It is also not hard to book a demo and sell it as a "comparison" to what they are currently doing. Any rookie can beg for a slot on a calendar.</p>

                <p>But that does not mean it is a real opportunity.</p>

                <h2>The 5 Questions Every SDR Must Answer</h2>

                <p>In our <a href="/sdr-sales-training/">SDR Sales Training</a>, we teach that a meeting is only a meeting if it is qualified.</p>

                <p>For any meeting booked your SDR should be able to answer these five questions.</p>

                <h3>1. Is the meeting booked with a decision maker?</h3>
                <p>If you are booking meetings with gatekeepers you are wasting your time. We discuss why you must go to the top in <a href="/blog/aim-high-cold-calling-strategy/">The High Road to Sales</a>.</p>

                <h3>2. What problem are they looking to solve that we can help with?</h3>
                <p>If there is no problem there is no sale.</p>

                <h3>3. How long has that problem existed?</h3>
                <p>This helps you understand urgency.</p>

                <h3>4. What have they done to fix it if anything?</h3>
                <p>This helps you understand their commitment to change.</p>

                <h3>5. What emotional attachment do they have to fixing said problem?</h3>
                <p>People buy on emotion. If they do not care about the problem they will not buy the solution.</p>

                <p>If your SDR cannot tell you this then your meeting is just a hit and hope strategy.</p>

                <h2>Quantity vs Quality</h2>

                <p>You could book 20 meetings a week but if they do not turn up or have no authority or have no problem or have no money what is the point?</p>

                <p>This is the definition of the vanity metrics we warned about in <a href="/blog/stop-chasing-vanity-metrics/">Stop Chasing Vanity Metrics</a>.</p>

                <p>It looks good on a report but it creates zero revenue.</p>

                <h2>Change the Incentive</h2>

                <p>Plenty of companies pay their SDR per meeting. This encourages bad behavior.</p>

                <p>How about paying them for qualified meetings?</p>

                <p>When you do this they learn what prospecting actually is.</p>

                <p>Your Account Executives are not fed poor leads. They stop wasting time on demos that go nowhere.</p>

                <p>And the meetings might actually turn into revenue.</p>

                <p>That is the whole point right?</p>

                <p>If you want to stop filling calendars with ghosts and start filling them with revenue it is time to change how you measure success.</p>
