<p>Want to book more meetings via cold call?</p>

                <p>Then put the effort in.</p>

                <p>I recently started working with a new client here in Sydney who was struggling to get traction.</p>

                <p>When they approached me their situation was typical of many businesses trying to scale.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>They were looking to sell into a new Ideal Customer Profile (ICP).</li>
                    <li>They tried cold email and failed.</li>
                    <li>They tried LinkedIn messaging and got no results.</li>
                    <li>They had little experience with cold calling.</li>
                    <li>They had a broken data list.</li>
                    <li>They had no cold calling framework.</li>
                    <li>They didn't know what metrics to measure.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>They were doing everything except the one thing that actually works. They were relying on passive channels because they didn't know how to pick up the phone.</p>

                <h2>The Transformation Process</h2>

                <p>We have been working together fortnightly since November.</p>

                <p>We stripped everything back to basics.</p>

                <p>First we fixed the data. You cannot sell if you are calling the wrong numbers.</p>

                <p>Then we worked on the framework. We moved away from the robotic scripts and built a conversation structure that actually engages prospects. This is the foundation of our <a href="/sdr-sales-training/"><strong>SDR Sales Training</strong></a>.</p>

                <p>We also focused heavily on questioning. As we discuss in <a href="/blog/sales-excuses-translator/"><strong>The Sales Translator</strong></a>, if you ask the wrong questions you get the wrong answers.</p>

                <h2>The Results</h2>

                <p>At the start of January we mapped out exactly how many meetings we needed per month to hit his goals.</p>

                <p>We defined the metrics that mattered. We ignored the vanity metrics like "emails sent" and focused on conversations held. We detailed why this distinction is vital in <a href="/blog/stop-chasing-vanity-metrics/"><strong>Stop Chasing Vanity Metrics</strong></a>.</p>

                <p>The January target was hit.</p>

                <p>They went from zero traction to a predictable pipeline in just a few months.</p>

                <h2>Sales is a Gym</h2>

                <p>Sales is a profession. It cannot be solved in a "feel good" workshop where everyone gets a high five and goes back to their old habits.</p>

                <p>It is no different from the gym. You need to put the reps in.</p>

                <p>You need to learn from those that actually cold call now not 20 years ago.</p>

                <p>You need consistent coaching and accountability. This is why we structure our <a href="/account-executive-training/"><strong>Account Executive Training</strong></a> around long-term implementation rather than one-off events.</p>

                <h2>Results Over Engagement</h2>

                <p>Think cold calling is dead?</p>

                <p>This client tried the "modern" methods of email and LinkedIn. They failed.</p>

                <p>They picked up the phone and they won.</p>

                <p>You can enjoy all the engagements on your LinkedIn posts while me and my clients continue to succeed.</p>

                <p>If you are tired of failing with email and want to build a real outbound engine get in touch.</p>

                <p>Let's put the reps in.</p>
