<p>There is nothing to lose by cold calling. You can only gain.</p>

                <p>We spend so much time worrying about the outcome of a call. We worry about interrupting people. We worry about what they will think of us.</p>

                <p>But you need to keep it in perspective.</p>

                <p>Yes it can be tough. But you are not fighting in a war.</p>

                <p>Yes someone might be rude to you. But someone may also be rude to you at the supermarket or in the pub. You do not stop going to the shops because of it.</p>

                <h2>Rejection is Data</h2>

                <p>Yes you will get a lot of people saying no.</p>

                <p>But in our <a href="/sdr-sales-training/">SDR Sales Training</a>, we teach that rejection isn't just a "no." It is market feedback. It is data collection.</p>

                <p>If they say no you have learned something about their situation. If they say no you are one step closer to the person who will say yes.</p>

                <p>Yes some people won't pick up. Plenty of others will.</p>

                <p>Yes some people you call will be in a mood. That is on them not you. You do not know what has happened to them that day. They might have just spilled coffee on their laptop. Do not take it personally.</p>

                <h2>The Zero Dollar Logic</h2>

                <p>Here is the math that should cure your fear.</p>

                <p>Before you make the call the current revenue from that business or account is $0.</p>

                <p>You can't get lower than $0.</p>

                <p>You won't owe them money after the call. The worst case scenario is that you stay exactly where you are right now.</p>

                <p>This is the mindset shift required to <a href="/blog/overcome-call-reluctance/">Overcome Call Reluctance</a>. When you realize you are already at the bottom the only way is up.</p>

                <h2>The Upside</h2>

                <p>But look at what you can gain.</p>

                <p>You may end up getting the meeting.<br>
                You may end up with the sale.<br>
                You may end up really helping someone fix a problem they have been struggling with for months.</p>

                <p>We have seen this happen time and time again in our <a href="/blog/cold-calling-case-study/">Cold Calling Case Study</a>. One dial can change the trajectory of your entire quarter.</p>

                <p>The risk is zero. The reward is limitless.</p>

                <p>Get on with it.</p>
