<p>Learn outbound or be in sales hell forever.</p>

                <p>This might sound dramatic but it is the reality of the modern sales career.</p>

                <p>Unless you can generate your own business you will only ever spend your days taking orders.</p>

                <p>You will go from big corporate company to big corporate company hoping that marketing or your manager will lay deals on a plate for you.</p>

                <p>You are not a salesperson. You are a passenger.</p>

                <h2>The Corporate Trap</h2>

                <p>It is easy to hide in a big machine. The brand does the heavy lifting. The marketing budget is huge. The leads flow in.</p>

                <p>But what happens when the leads dry up?</p>

                <p>What happens when the economy turns and the marketing budget gets cut?</p>

                <p>You underperform.</p>

                <p>Suddenly you have to try and sell to every weak demo request that comes in. You get desperate. And you will probably end up on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP).</p>

                <p>We discuss this cycle of dependency in <strong><a href="/blog/warm-call-delusion/">The Warm Call Delusion</a></strong>. If you are waiting for the phone to ring you are not in control of your income.</p>

                <h2>The Cycle of Mediocrity</h2>

                <p>If you leave that job because "the territory was bad" or "the leads were weak" you just repeat the cycle.</p>

                <p>You have to go back into another big corporate company where you can continue to take orders.</p>

                <p>You are safe for a while.</p>

                <p>Just until you are replaced when the company goes through a restructure. And they always go through a restructure.</p>

                <p>Companies keep the hunters. They fire the order takers.</p>

                <h2>Start-Ups Need Hunters</h2>

                <p>Do you want to work for exciting new start-ups? Do you want to work on new product ideas?</p>

                <p>Forget it.</p>

                <p>Start-ups do not have brand recognition. They do not have inbound leads.</p>

                <p>You will need to know outbound.</p>

                <p>If you want to break into the high-growth sector you need the skills we teach in our <strong><a href="/sdr-sales-training/">SDR Sales Training</a></strong>. You need to be able to create something from nothing.</p>

                <h2>Take Control of Your Life</h2>

                <p>Learning outbound is the hardest but most critical skill when it comes to selling.</p>

                <p>If you can cold call you can work anywhere. You can write your own paycheck. You are never afraid of losing your job because you know you can pick up the phone and find a new opportunity tomorrow.</p>

                <p>This is the confidence we build in our <strong><a href="/account-executive-training/">Account Executive Training</a></strong>.</p>

                <p>The choice is yours.</p>
