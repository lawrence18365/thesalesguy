<p>"Our team needs more confidence on the phone."</p>

                <p>I hear this constantly from Sales Directors when discussing <strong>sales training in Sydney</strong>.</p>

                <p>"Sure. Mind if I challenge that?" I ask.</p>

                <p>"Go ahead."</p>

                <p>"What is the purpose of a cold call?"</p>

                <p>"To get a meeting."</p>

                <p>That is the problem with nearly all sales teams I talk to.</p>

                <p>They think the purpose of a call is to get a meeting.</p>

                <p>That is not the purpose at all. That is the outcome.</p>

                <h2>The Confidence Gap</h2>

                <p>If your team does not understand the purpose of what they are doing how can they execute it?</p>

                <p>Simple. They can't.</p>

                <p>This is why they lack confidence. They are chasing a metric rather than a conversation.</p>

                <p>If they spend their whole day trying to get meetings out of everyone guess what will happen?</p>

                <p>They will beg. They will push. They will plead. They will sound needy.</p>

                <p>No one buys off those salespeople.</p>

                <p>This behavior leads to the exact desperation we warn against in <a href="/blog/stop-begging-for-meetings/">Stop Begging for Meetings</a>. You sound like a lost little yapping puppy who needs food.</p>

                <h2>From Intellect to Emotion</h2>

                <p>The true purpose of a cold call is specific.</p>

                <p>It is to move the prospect from intellect to emotion on the problems you fix.</p>

                <p>That is how people buy.</p>

                <p>They start the call analyzing you with their intellect. Your job is to make them feel the pain of their current situation.</p>

                <p>If you can do that the meeting happens naturally.</p>

                <p>In our <a href="/sdr-sales-training/">SDR Sales Training</a>, we teach that if you focus on the problem the meeting takes care of itself.</p>

                <h2>The Outcome Follows the Process</h2>

                <p>If you do that enough you will be flooded with meetings. You will have prospects chasing you.</p>

                <p>But if you skip the "problem" part and go straight to the "meeting" part you will fail.</p>

                <p>You need to know what you fix. You need to know how it resonates. You need to ask questions.</p>

                <p>When you focus on the process the confidence returns because you are no longer asking for a favor. You are offering a solution.</p>

                <p>This is the difference between an amateur and a professional. It is the core of our <a href="/account-executive-training/">Account Executive Training</a>.</p>

                <p>Stop sounding desperate.</p>

                <p>Start sounding like an expert.</p>

                <p>And if you can't figure that out get in touch.</p>
