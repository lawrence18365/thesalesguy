<p>"I prefer to make warm calls."</p>

                <p>I hear this constantly. And to be honest, I still don't really know what this actually means.</p>

                <p>I think it is where most salespeople send an email first, a LinkedIn message, or a webinar offering "value" before picking up the phone.</p>

                <p>But let's look at the reality. If the call following is not expected, it is still cold.</p>

                <h2>The "Big Whoop" Factor</h2>

                <p>The only difference with a so called warm call is that you can say your name and business name and they may know a little of what you do.</p>

                <p>Big whoop.</p>

                <p>Because of that brand recognition, the caller may give you a little bit more time at the start. Maybe five seconds instead of three.</p>

                <p>But if your call still sucks, warming up the prospect is completely pointless.</p>

                <p>Name recognition will not save a bad pitch. If you don't know how to engage a stranger, knowing your logo won't help them. We discussed the importance of skill over gimmicks in <a href="/blog/cold-calling-case-study/">Forget 'Cold Calling is Dead': A Case Study</a>. If you can't sell, "warmth" is irrelevant.</p>

                <h2>The Structure Does Not Change</h2>

                <p>Warming the prospect up does not mean the structure of the call should be any different.</p>

                <p>The structure is the exact same as a cold call in reality.</p>

                <p>Do they have problems?</p>

                <p>Does the impact of those problems warrant a solution?</p>

                <p>Are they qualified?</p>

                <p>If you are doing cold calling correctly, you don't even need to mention your full name or business name. So warming up is pointless.</p>

                <p>And you don't have to lead with what you do, either. You lead with what you fix.</p>

                <h2>Stop Wasting Time on Sequencing</h2>

                <p>Next time someone tries to sell you a course on "warm calls" or "social selling sequences," remember this simple truth.</p>

                <p>If you treat the prospect right, you can call them first. You can do this without spending hours on sequencing, LinkedIn comments, or hosting a webinar.</p>

                <p>Those hours spent "warming up" leads are often just busy work. As I wrote in <a href="/blog/always-on-sales-myth/">The 'Always On' Sales Myth: Stop Working Harder</a>, filling your day with admin and non revenue generating activities is the quickest way to burnout.</p>

                <p>It is the same call anyway.</p>
