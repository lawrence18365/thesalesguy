<p>Last week I was on a cold call.</p>

                <p>After a bit of back and forth we both decided that I wasn't for them which is fine.</p>

                <p>The prospect really liked the approach. They stated how I wasn't pushy and was understanding of their situation.</p>

                <p>They mentioned that although my services were not for them right now it would be good to stay in contact and to go for a coffee.</p>

                <p>And while that was a nice offer it really would have been pointless.</p>

                <div class="section-divider"></div>

                <h2>The Corporate Trap</h2>

                <p>This is where sales reps go wrong.</p>

                <p>In the corporate world the salesperson would have agreed.</p>

                <p>They would have booked the meeting. That is a plus one on the dashboard and a big high five from the CRO.</p>

                <p>They would justify it by saying "Who knows it could be an opportunity. Let's see!"</p>

                <p>Behave.</p>

                <p>Your job as a salesperson is not to make friends.</p>

                <p>It is to find prospects who have problems that you fix.</p>

                <p>Booking a meeting with someone who has explicitly told you they are not a fit is the definition of the vanity metrics we warned about in <a href="/blog/stop-chasing-vanity-metrics/">Stop Chasing Vanity Metrics</a>.</p>

                <p>It looks like work. It feels like work. But it generates zero revenue.</p>

                <h2>Disqualify Early</h2>

                <p>You need to learn to disqualify early.</p>

                <p>Stop acting busy to appease the dashboards.</p>

                <p>In our <a href="/account-executive-training/">Account Executive Training</a>, we teach that time is your most valuable asset. If you spend an hour having coffee with a "nice" person who will never buy you have lost an hour that could have been spent finding a real buyer.</p>

                <h2>Revenue is the Only Metric</h2>

                <p>Your only metric that matters is revenue.</p>

                <p>Even if you are an SDR your goal is revenue.</p>

                <p>If you fill your pipeline with "coffees" and "catch ups" you are hiding from the truth. We discuss this avoidance behavior in <a href="/blog/always-on-sales-myth/">The Always On Sales Myth</a>. You are staying busy to avoid the hard work of finding new business.</p>

                <p>Focus on the right people.</p>

                <p>If they are not a fit let them go.</p>

                <p>Don't book the coffee. Pick up the phone and find the next one.</p>
