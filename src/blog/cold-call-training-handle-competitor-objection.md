<p>You are on a cold call and the prospect says...</p>

<p>"We are using a competitor."</p>

<p>What do you do next?</p>

<p>Last week I saw a post that said you should say...</p>

<p>"That's fine perhaps we can show you what we do and you can use it as a comparison."</p>

<p>It is honestly terrible advice.</p>

<h2>The Comparison Trap</h2>

<p>Why is this advice so bad?</p>

<p><strong>1. You haven't tried to understand the situation.</strong><br>
Your prospect wants to be understood not convinced. This is basic human psychology. If you pitch immediately you signal that you do not care about their current setup.</p>

<p><strong>2. You haven't tried to qualify the meeting.</strong><br>
Show up and hope is not a strategy. Just because they agreed to a comparison does not mean they have a problem.</p>

<p><strong>3. The meetings probably won't show up.</strong><br>
They have given you no reason to be there. Why would they attend a meeting to solve a problem they haven't admitted to having? This leads to the ghosting we discuss in <a href="/blog/warm-call-delusion/">The Warm Call Delusion</a>.</p>

<p><strong>4. You are turning yourself into a free consultant.</strong><br>
Your job is to sell not consult for free. If you give away your expertise without a commitment you devalue your service.</p>

<h2>Earn the Right to Pitch</h2>

<p>Handling the above statement like that is just a waste of everyone's time.</p>

<p>Instead look to understand and see if there is a gap.</p>

<p>In our <a href="/sdr-sales-training/">SDR Sales Training</a>, we teach a simple pivot.</p>

<p>"Ok understood. Do you mind if I ask two questions to see if I can help?"</p>

<p><strong>"What is one thing you really like about working with them?"</strong></p>

<p>This disarms them. It shows you are not there to bash the competition.</p>

<p><strong>"And if there is one thing you could be doing better what does that look like?"</strong></p>

<p>This opens the door.</p>

<h2>Qualify the Pain</h2>

<p>Once you have the answers to those questions you the salesperson can then decide if it is worth taking further.</p>

<p>If they say "nothing everything is perfect" you disqualify them and move on. You save yourself the time of a pointless demo.</p>

<p>If they give you a pain point you explore it.</p>

<p>This approach stops you from begging for attention. As we warned in <a href="/blog/stop-begging-for-meetings/">Stop Begging for Meetings</a>, begging kills deals.</p>

<p>Start earning it.</p>

<p>Ask the hard questions. Find the real gap.</p>

<p>And stop doing free comparisons.</p>
