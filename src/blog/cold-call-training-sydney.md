<p>A CEO in North Sydney recently mentioned something interesting on a cold call with me. He admitted that he has only received one decent piece of outreach all year.</p>

                <p>And even that did not get a response.</p>

                <p>It was a letter in the post. The letter did not land but at least it caught attention. The shocking part is what happened next.</p>

                <p>Not one follow up call.</p>

                <p>I asked him a simple question.</p>

                <p>"How many cold calls do you get these days?"</p>

                <p>"Hardly any," he replied. "It used to be all about cold calling but everyone is hiding behind computers these days."</p>

                <h2>The Conversation That Booked the Meeting</h2>

                <p>This was the perfect opening. I had already followed the golden rule we discussed in <a href="/blog/aim-high-cold-calling-strategy/">The High Road to Sales</a> by going straight to the top. Now I had to prove my value.</p>

                <p>"Do you think the flow of this call is thoughtful? Much like the letter?" I asked.</p>

                <p>"Yes," he said.</p>

                <p>"So let's pretend I could get your team making thoughtful calls like this. Is there any reason you wouldn't invite me in to see if I can help you?"</p>

                <p>"Not at all."</p>

                <p>Meeting booked.</p>

                <p>Notice the lack of desperation. As we covered in <a href="/blog/stop-begging-for-meetings/">Stop Begging for Meetings</a>, I didn't beg. I simply asked a logical question based on his answer.</p>

                <h2>Why You Should Be Excited</h2>

                <p>If you are looking for sales training in Sydney, this story should excite you.</p>

                <p>Cold calling has never been easier.</p>

                <p>Read that again.</p>

                <p>It has never been easier because the bar is on the floor. All of your competitors are sending emails or generic LinkedIn messages. They are playing around with creative ideas like letters but they never follow up on them.</p>

                <p>They are "hiding behind computers" because they believe the lie we debunked in <a href="/blog/warm-call-delusion/">The Warm Call Delusion</a>. They are wasting hours on "social selling" instead of picking up the phone.</p>

                <p>This digital noise creates a massive opportunity for you.</p>

                <p>We saw this clearly in our recent data from <a href="/blog/cold-calling-case-study/">Forget 'Cold Calling is Dead': A Case Study</a>. While everyone else zigs with automation and bots, you can zag with a human conversation.</p>

                <h2>What We Teach in Our Sydney Workshops</h2>

                <p>The CEO I spoke to was not surprised by the call. He was relieved. He wanted a human connection.</p>

                <p>In our <a href="/sdr-sales-training/">SDR Sales Training</a> sessions across Australia, we teach that fear usually comes from a lack of skill. If you are scared to dial, it just means you need to practice the right framework.</p>

                <p>Here is how we break it down.</p>

                <h3>1. The Pattern Break</h3>

                <p>Most salespeople sound exactly the same. They use the same pitch and the same tone. You need to sound different within the first seven seconds.</p>

                <h3>2. The Permission Ask</h3>

                <p>Notice how I asked the CEO for permission to proceed based on logic. I did not pitch my product. I pitched the next step. This is a core part of our <a href="/account-executive-training/">Account Executive Training</a>.</p>

                <h3>3. Removing the Excuses</h3>

                <p>We translated the common objections in <a href="/blog/sales-excuses-translator/">The Sales Translator</a>. When you understand that "send me an email" is often just a polite way of saying "go away" you can learn to navigate around it.</p>

                <h2>Stop Being Scared</h2>

                <p>There is no reason to ever be scared of a cold call.</p>

                <p>You should be excited. The opportunity is endless.</p>

                <p>While your competitors are burning out working 11 hour days trying to "warm up" leads, a trap we discussed in <a href="/blog/always-on-sales-myth/">The Always On Sales Myth</a>, you can cut through.</p>

                <p>While they are busy writing documents and hoping for a response, a waste of time we highlighted in <a href="/blog/death-of-sales-proposal/">The Death of the Sales Proposal</a>, you can be booking meetings.</p>
