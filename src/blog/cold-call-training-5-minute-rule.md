<p>"Any cold call lasting longer than 5 minutes means you've lost control."</p>

                <p>I hear this advice from sales gurus all the time.</p>

                <p>My thoughts?</p>

                <p><strong>Rubbish.</strong></p>

                <p>Firstly if your cold calls are that short then it shows that you cannot keep a conversation interesting. It shows you do not understand the purpose of what you are doing.</p>

                <p>The purpose of a cold call is not to get a meeting. It is to see if your prospect has an emotional attachment to the problems you fix.</p>

                <p>The meeting is the outcome. It is not the goal.</p>

                <div class="section-divider"></div>

                <h2>Emotion vs Intellect</h2>

                <p>People buy with emotions and justify with intellect. You need to be selling to both.</p>

                <p>If a prospect cannot explain to you how a problem resonates in their world then offering a meeting is pointless. You need to uncover their frustration. You need to understand why they want to change.</p>

                <p>This process often takes longer than five minutes.</p>

                <p>We teach this depth in our <a href="/sdr-sales-training/">SDR Sales Training</a>. If you rush to the pitch you miss the pain.</p>

                <p>Why meet an unqualified prospect? Why organise a meeting with someone who is just going to ghost you?</p>

                <p>It might look great on your dashboard but vanity metrics mean nothing. The end goal is revenue. We explored why these numbers lie in <a href="/blog/stop-chasing-vanity-metrics/">Stop Chasing Vanity Metrics</a>.</p>

                <h2>Respecting the C-Suite</h2>

                <p>Secondly you should only ever prospect at the C-suite or Director level. Because that is where decisions are made.</p>

                <p>If a time-poor Director has a problem you might be able to help with and is willing to give up more than five minutes then get into it.</p>

                <p>They do not give up their time for anything. If they are staying on the line it is because you are adding value.</p>

                <p>This aligns with our strategy in <a href="/blog/aim-high-cold-calling-strategy/">Aim High Cold Calling Strategy</a>. When you speak to decision makers the conversation naturally goes deeper because the problems are bigger.</p>

                <h2>Longer Calls = Easier Sales</h2>

                <p>My last three clients obtained via cold call resulted in conversations that lasted for 20 minutes or more.</p>

                <p>Just think how easy the sales meeting is when you have discovered that much information on the first call. You walk into the demo already knowing exactly how to win.</p>

                <p>If your cold calls are short it is "spray and pray."</p>

                <div class="article-pullquote">
                    "Why work harder than you have to? Start listening to the prospect."
                </div>

                <p>Yes this does work but it is also painfully long and inefficient. You have to make hundreds of calls to get the same result as a few good ones.</p>

                <p>We proved the value of quality over quantity in our <a href="/blog/cold-calling-case-study/">Cold Calling Case Study</a>.</p>

                <p>Why work harder than you have to?</p>

                <p>Stop watching the clock. Start listening to the prospect.</p>
