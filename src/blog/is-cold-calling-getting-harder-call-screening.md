<p>"Cold calling is only going to get tougher with call screening!"</p>

<p>I hear this excuse in every sales training session I run.</p>

<p>Let's cut this out.</p>

<p>Cold calling has not got harder.</p>

<p>It is easier than ever.</p>

<h2>The Golden Age of Outbound</h2>

<p>You can get mobile numbers for $0.003 cents.</p>

<p>You don't have to deal with as many gatekeepers. In the old days you had to charm a receptionist just to get a name. Now you have the direct dial.</p>

<p>You no longer ever have to call a switchboard.</p>

<p>You are not sending emails during Christmas in hope a prospect has their mobile number on their out of office reply.</p>

<p>You are no longer using a telephone directory. Your computer can even call people for you.</p>

<p>This is the easiest time in history to reach a decision maker.</p>

<h2>The Competitor Advantage</h2>

<p>While you are complaining about call screening your competitors are spamming inboxes.</p>

<p>They are sending thousands of automated LinkedIn messages that get ignored.</p>

<p>This digital noise creates a massive opportunity. As we proved in <a href="/blog/cold-calling-case-study/">Cold Calling Case Study</a>, the phone is the one channel that cuts through the clutter.</p>

<h2>The Real Problem</h2>

<p>It is easy to get a hold of prospects.</p>

<p>The problem is not call screening. The problem is you just don't make enough dials.</p>

<p>You make ten calls and give up because two people didn't answer. That is not a market problem. That is an effort problem.</p>

<p>We discuss this lack of resilience in <a href="/blog/overcome-call-reluctance/">How to Overcome Call Reluctance: The Two-Choice Mindset</a>. If you are looking for excuses you will always find them.</p>

<h2>Stop Making Excuses</h2>

<p>Cold calling used to be tough. It really isn't anymore.</p>

<p>The technology is better. The data is better. The competition is weaker.</p>

<p>If you are failing it is because you are not putting in the work.</p>

<p>Stop making excuses.</p>

<p>Pick up the phone and dial.</p>
