<p>The other day I was on a call with a prospect who had been approached by another sales trainer.</p>

                <p>They did not go ahead with them.</p>

                <p>Why?</p>

                <p>The answer is simple. The trainer could not sell.</p>

                <p>The trainer called them but did not qualify them. Instead they emailed a book over on sales
                    methodologies.</p>

                <p>A meeting was arranged where the trainer went on to ask minimal discovery questions. They then spent
                    the hour speaking at the prospect about said methodologies. It was a classic case of "Look at how
                    much I know" rather than "Let me understand your problem."</p>

                <p>They then proceeded to send a proposal to the prospect quoting well over $30k.</p>

                <p>They are now chasing the prospect for an answer.</p>

                <p>Here is a hint. No answer is a no.</p>

                <h2>The Irony of Bad Sales Training</h2>

                <p>It is shocking how many people selling sales training in Sydney cannot actually sell.</p>

                <p>They rely on theory. They rely on books. They rely on complex methodologies that look good on a
                    whiteboard but fail on the phone.</p>

                <p>If you are considering bringing a trainer into your business they must be able to sell themselves.
                </p>

                <p>If they act like your current underperforming sales team why would you hire them to fix your team?
                </p>

                <h2>What to Look For</h2>

                <p>Companies can have sales problems for a huge number of reasons. But if you are teaching sales you
                    should know the basics.</p>

                <p>Here is the litmus test I use.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Can they make a cold call?</strong><br>
                    If a trainer cannot pick up the phone and book a meeting with you properly how are they going to
                    teach your team to do it? We prove this works every day in our <a href="/sdr-sales-training/">SDR
                        Sales Training</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Can they keep control of the process?</strong><br>
                    The trainer in my story lost control immediately. They sent a book. They rambled in the meeting.
                    They lost the deal. You need a trainer who can command a room and a process.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Do they send proposals?</strong><br>
                    Sending a document and hoping for a signature is amateur hour. As we discussed in <a
                        href="/blog/death-of-sales-proposal/">The Death of the Sales Proposal</a>, if you are writing
                    proposals you are wasting time. The deal should be agreed upon verbally before any paperwork is
                    sent.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Do they chase?</strong><br>
                    Chasing is begging. If a trainer is chasing you for an answer it means they did not get a clear next
                    step in the meeting. We teach how to avoid this desperation in <a
                        href="/blog/stop-begging-for-meetings/">Stop Begging for Meetings</a>.</p>

                <h2>Practice What You Preach</h2>

                <p>When you are looking for sales coaching, look at the behavior of the person selling to you.</p>

                <p>Are they asking deep questions?<br>
                    Are they challenging your thinking?<br>
                    Are they uncovering pain?</p>

                <p>Or are they just pitching?</p>

                <p>If they are pitching you methodologies and sending you PDFs, run away.</p>

                <p>They should be able to sell themselves.</p>

                <p>Not act like your current sales team.</p>
