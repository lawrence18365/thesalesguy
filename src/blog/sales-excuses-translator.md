<p>If you spend any time on sales floors, in boardrooms, or scrolling through LinkedIn, you hear certain phrases on repeat.</p>

                <p>They sound like valid reasons. They sound like logical explanations for missed targets and empty pipelines.</p>

                <p>But usually, they are just excuses.</p>

                <p>As humans, we are far more likely to blame external factors due to self serving bias. It protects our ego. But it kills our sales performance.</p>

                <p>It is time to translate what these common sales phrases actually mean.</p>

                <h3>The Outreach Excuses</h3>

                <p><strong>The Phrase:</strong> "Cold calling is dead."</p>

                <p><strong>The Translation:</strong> "I find it too hard and I can't be bothered to learn."</p>

                <p>This is the most common one I hear. We proved this wrong earlier this week. As discussed in <a href="/blog/cold-calling-case-study/">Forget 'Cold Calling is Dead': A Case Study</a>, cold calling is only dead for those who refuse to master the skill.</p>

                <p><strong>The Phrase:</strong> "Warm calling is alive."</p>

                <p><strong>The Translation:</strong> "I sent out donuts to some prospects and one returned my call."</p>

                <p>Relying on gimmicks or waiting for "warm" leads is a slow death for a salesperson. You need to be able to generate your own heat.</p>

                <p><strong>The Phrase:</strong> "Our market is all about relationships."</p>

                <p><strong>The Translation:</strong> "I only know how to speak to prospects and customers I already know."</p>

                <p>This is fear disguised as strategy. Real relationship building starts with a stranger.</p>

                <h3>The Pipeline and Process Excuses</h3>

                <p><strong>The Phrase:</strong> "These leads are bad."</p>

                <p><strong>The Translation:</strong> "I called 3 people and no one placed an order."</p>

                <p>Volume matters. Persistence matters. If you give up after three dials, the lead isn't the problem. The effort is.</p>

                <p><strong>The Phrase:</strong> "The sales are coming in soon, my pipeline is huge."</p>

                <p><strong>The Translation:</strong> "I have sent proposals to every single prospect that asked for one without qualifying anything."</p>

                <p>This is a dangerous place to be. You are busy, but you aren't productive. You are likely working 11 hour days chasing ghosts, a trap we covered in <a href="/blog/always-on-sales-myth/">The 'Always On' Sales Myth: Stop Working Harder</a>. You need to disqualify harder.</p>

                <p><strong>The Phrase:</strong> "No one shows up to meetings from cold calls."</p>

                <p><strong>The Translation:</strong> "I beg and plead for placeholders in their diary."</p>

                <p>If you beg for a meeting, they won't respect your time. If you let them disqualify themselves or convince you to meet, they show up. We broke this down in <a href="/blog/stop-begging-for-meetings/">Stop Begging for Meetings: The 2026 Cold Call Power Flip</a>.</p>

                <h3>The Market Excuses</h3>

                <p><strong>The Phrase:</strong> "Our price is too high."</p>

                <p><strong>The Translation:</strong> "I crumble the second my prospect asks me for a discount."</p>

                <p>Price is rarely the only factor. If you can't hold your ground on price, you haven't built enough value in the discovery phase.</p>

                <p><strong>The Phrase:</strong> "The recession is killing us."</p>

                <p><strong>The Translation:</strong> "I only know how to take orders and they've dried up."</p>

                <p>When the tide goes out, you see who is swimming naked. Order takers suffer in tough economies. Hunters thrive because they go out and create opportunities regardless of the GDP.</p>

                <h3>Stop Blaming External Factors</h3>

                <p>The thing is, selling can be incredibly difficult. It takes years of practice, learning and listening.</p>

                <p>But the truth is, the reason you are not selling is usually you.</p>

                <p>The moment you stop blaming the economy, the leads, the price, or the marketing department, your life as a salesperson will become much easier. You take control back.</p>

                <p>If you run a business or sales team and you are sick of them blaming external factors, give me a shout.</p>

                <p>Don't accept mediocrity.</p>
