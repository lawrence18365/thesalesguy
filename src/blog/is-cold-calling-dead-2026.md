<p>It is 2026.</p>

                <p>Cold calling is dead.</p>
                
                <p>Just listen to the social media gurus.</p>

                <p>They are all making loads of money through "social selling" and automated sequences and LinkedIn spamming.</p>

                <p>No phones for them. Loads of money! That is the dream.</p>

                <p>The best bit? You can do it too.</p>

                <p>Just buy their $1,997 course and it is all yours. So easy.</p>

                <h2>The Great Distraction</h2>

                <p>I am being sarcastic of course.</p>

                <p>But this narrative is the best thing that has ever happened to my business.</p>

                <p>The more courses everyone buys the easier cold calling becomes for me and my clients.</p>

                <p>While your competitors are hiding behind their screens trying to automate a human relationship the phone lines are wide open.</p>

                <p>They are relying on the lie we debunked in <a href="/blog/warm-call-delusion/">The Warm Call Delusion</a>. They think if they post enough content the leads will magically appear.</p>

                <p>Decision makers are drowning in LinkedIn DMs. They are deleting thousands of automated emails. But their desk phones? They are silent.</p>

                <p>This digital noise creates a vacuum. And if you are brave enough to pick up the phone you can fill it.</p>

                <h2>The Competitive Advantage</h2>

                <p>If everyone else is zigging you should zag.</p>

                <p>We have seen this shift clearly in our recent data from <a href="/blog/cold-calling-case-study/">Cold Calling Case Study</a>. The connect rates for cold calling are actually going up because no one else is doing it.</p>

                <p>Think cold calling doesn't work?</p>

                <p>I picked up a major client last year simply by picking up the phone. No warm up. No social selling. Just a conversation.</p>

                <p>If you are looking for sales training in Sydney, you have two choices in 2026.</p>

                <p>You can join the herd and compete with millions of spam bots.</p>

                <p>Or you can learn the skill that actually prints money.</p>

                <h2>Make Money Together</h2>

                <p>If you run a sales team who are scared of the phone you have a problem.</p>

                <p>Fear usually comes from a lack of skill. We discuss how to translate that fear in <a href="/blog/sales-excuses-translator/">The Sales Translator</a>.</p>

                <p>Do not let your team hide behind the "cold calling is dead" excuse. It is just a convenient way to avoid the hard work.</p>
