<p>"Lee, how do you handle this objection?"</p>
                
                <p>"When the prospect says send me an email, what do you say?"</p>
                
                <p>When I am running sales training in Sydney, I always get a variation of the above question.</p>
                
                <p>Reps want a magic line. They want a silver bullet script that will instantly turn a brush-off into a booked meeting.</p>
                
                <p>And while you need to know how to handle certain situations it is the wrong question to ask.</p>
                
                <p>It is far more important to realise that all of your sales issues come from upstream.</p>

                <h2>The Upstream Problem</h2>

                <p>If you are constantly fighting fires at the end of the call it is because you started the fire at the beginning of the call.</p>

                <p>If your prospects keep saying "send me an email" it is likely you are talking far too much about yourself or whatever your product does.</p>

                <p>This objection is rarely a request for information. It is a polite way of telling you to go away.</p>

                <p>In our <a href="/sdr-sales-training/">SDR Sales Training</a>, we teach that this specific objection is usually a symptom of a bad pitch. You have failed to hook their interest so they are using the path of least resistance to get off the phone.</p>

                <p>It is not them. It is you.</p>

                <h2>Stop Looking for Magic Words</h2>

                <p>Stop asking how to handle certain objections.</p>

                <p>Start asking why your prospects keep saying the same thing.</p>

                <p>If you keep getting hit with the same issue over and over you need to look at your process. You are likely falling into the trap of pitching features rather than problems.</p>

                <p>We discuss how to interpret these signals in <a href="/blog/sales-excuses-translator/">The Sales Translator</a>. When they say "send me an email" they actually mean "you have not given me a reason to stay on the line."</p>

                <p>Don't try to find a clever comeback to "send me an email."</p>

                <p>Instead you should go back and listen to your call recording. Look at the first 30 seconds. Did you sound like every other telemarketer? Did you talk about your company history?</p>

                <p>That is where the sale was lost. Not at the objection.</p>

                <h2>How to Fix It</h2>

                <p>To make this objection disappear you need to improve your pitch.</p>

                <p>You need to stop broadcasting and start diagnosing.</p>

                <p>Most importantly you need to ask decent questions and listen to what your prospect is saying.</p>

                <p>This is the core of our <a href="/account-executive-training/">Account Executive Training</a>. If you ask a thought-provoking question early in the call the prospect will not ask for an email. They will answer the question.</p>

                <p>Once they answer the question you are in a conversation. And people do not ask people they are having a conversation with to "just send an email."</p>

                <h2>The Result</h2>

                <p>If you focus on the beginning of the call the end of the call takes care of itself.</p>

                <p>Stop obsessing over the objection handlers.</p>

                <p>Look upstream. Fix the hook. Fix the questions.</p>

                <p>And maybe that objection will suddenly disappear.</p>
