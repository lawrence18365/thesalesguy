<p>"How do you deal with the constant rejection of cold calling?"</p>

                <p>I get asked this question in almost every <strong>sales training</strong> workshop I run.</p>

                <p>It is simple.</p>

                <p>Bad calls happen.</p>

                <p>You can overthink it. Or you can move onto the next one.</p>

                <h2>Perspective Check</h2>

                <p>You will go through much worse in your life than a bad call.</p>

                <p>Let's look at the reality of the situation.</p>

                <p>No one close to you has died.</p>

                <p>You haven't died.</p>

                <p>No one close to you has gotten ill as a result.</p>

                <p>You haven't got ill.</p>

                <p>Your salary is still getting paid.</p>

                <p>So is your pension.</p>

                <p>You still have food in your fridge.</p>

                <p>You are not getting evicted as a result of the call.</p>

                <p>The call hasn't made you bankrupt.</p>

                <p>A stranger who is probably having a bad day has hung up or told you to go away.</p>

                <p>Who cares?</p>

                <h2>The "Next One" Mentality</h2>

                <p>This is the mindset required to <a href="/blog/overcome-call-reluctance/"><strong>Overcome Call Reluctance</strong></a>.</p>

                <p>If you let one bad call drag you down it will only ruin your next call. You carry that negative energy into the next conversation. The next prospect hears it in your voice. They reject you too.</p>

                <p>It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

                <p>Most prospects respect the craft. They know you are doing a job.</p>

                <p>We see this in our <a href="/blog/cold-calling-case-study/"><strong>Cold Calling Case Study</strong></a>. The best performers are the ones who have the shortest memory. They hang up, reset, and dial again immediately.</p>

                <h2>Zero Effect</h2>

                <p>A few bad cold calls have zero effect on your life.</p>

                <p>They do not define your worth. They do not define your career.</p>

                <p>If you are letting a stranger on the phone ruin your day you are giving them too much power.</p>

                <p>Get on with it.</p>

                <p>Pick up the phone. Dial the next number.</p>

                <p>The next one might be the best call of your career. But you will never know if you are still sulking about the last one.</p>
