<p>Are your reps discounting to win deals?</p>

<p>Probably.</p>

<p>But why?</p>

<p>It is easy to blame their negotiation skills. It is easy to say they crumbled under pressure.</p>

<p>But the real reason is much simpler.</p>

<p>They discount because they do not cold call enough.</p>

<h2>The Scarcity Mindset</h2>

<p>Discounting happens because your salespeople need to sell to most prospects they meet.</p>

<p>They have no choice but to bend over backwards.</p>

<p>They simply do not sit enough meetings to hit target. They might have a target of five closed deals a month but they only sit six inbound meetings.</p>

<p>Do the math. They have to close almost every single one of them to survive.</p>

<p>If they lose one deal they miss their commission. If they lose two they are on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP).</p>

<p>This scarcity creates desperation. And as we discussed in <a href="/blog/stop-begging-for-meetings/">Stop Begging for Meetings</a>, desperation smells terrible to a buyer.</p>

<p>When a prospect senses that you <em>need</em> the deal they will squeeze you on price. And you will say yes because you have no other options.</p>

<h2>The End of Quarter Scramble</h2>

<p>If the inbound leads do not convert your reps are left scrambling around at the end of the quarter.</p>

<p>They start offering 20% off. They start throwing in free implementation. They hope it is enough to keep their job safe.</p>

<p>They send out desperate contracts hoping for a signature. We highlighted why this approach fails in <a href="/blog/death-of-sales-proposal/">The Death of the Sales Proposal</a>.</p>

<p>Price should be a confirmation of value not a Hail Mary pass to save a bad quarter.</p>

<h2>The Abundance of Cold Calling</h2>

<p>The more prospective meetings you have the easier selling becomes.</p>

<p>Cold calling gives you those meetings if you do it with volume and skill.</p>

<p>The only thing your prospect has over you is the choice to spend their money.</p>

<p>But if you have a full pipeline the dynamic flips.</p>

<p>If you have 30 qualified meetings in your calendar you do not care if one prospect asks for a discount. You can say no. You can walk away.</p>

<p>You have choice.</p>

<p>This is the mindset we build in our <a href="/account-executive-training/">Account Executive Training</a>. We teach reps that the ability to walk away is the strongest negotiation tactic in the world.</p>

<h2>Fix the Upstream Problem</h2>

<p>Next time you see your reps giving away a large percentage of your profit margin do not run a workshop on "price objections."</p>

<p>That is a band-aid on a bullet hole.</p>

<p>Teach them how to cold call.</p>

<p>Your sales problems are all coming from upstream and the top of the funnel.</p>

<p>If you fix the pipeline the negotiation fixes itself.</p>

<p>Live a life of abundance.</p>
