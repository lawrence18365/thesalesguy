<p>"Cold calling is all about booking a meeting."</p>

                <p>This advice has been all over LinkedIn this week.</p>

                <p>It is usually written by Sales Directors of well-known global brands who probably don't know what a cold call looks like. Well a good one anyway.</p>

                <p>Let's be honest. It is terrible advice.</p>

                <p>Your cold call should be all about your prospect. It should be about their problems. It should be about their world.</p>

                <p>It should not be about you.</p>

                <div class="section-divider"></div>

                <h2>The Self-Serving Trap</h2>

                <p>Focusing purely on the outcome or on getting a meeting is self-serving.</p>

                <p>Prospects do not want to deal with a self-serving salesperson. They can smell the commission breath a mile away.</p>

                <p>When you call with the sole intention of booking a slot on a calendar you treat the human on the other end like a number. You rush the conversation. You skip the listening part.</p>

                <p>They want their problems fixed. They want a different perspective. They want to be challenged. They want to be helped.</p>

                <p>They do not want someone calling them up begging for a virtual coffee saying "I'd love to show what we do."</p>

                <p>We discuss why this approach kills your credibility in <a href="/blog/stop-begging-for-meetings/">Stop Begging for Meetings</a>. If you have to beg for their time you have already lost the sale.</p>

                <h2>Get Invited In</h2>

                <p>Stop focusing on booking meetings.</p>

                <p>Start focusing on what is required to get a prospect to invite you in.</p>

                <p>This is a mindset shift we drill into teams during our <a href="/sdr-sales-training/">SDR Sales Training</a>.</p>

                <p>If you uncover enough pain and offer enough value the prospect will want to meet with you. They will ask you what the next steps are.</p>

                <p>That is the difference between pushing a rope and pulling it.</p>

                <h2>Quality Over Dashboards</h2>

                <p>When you focus on just booking the meeting you end up with low-quality slots.</p>

                <p>You get "ghosted." You get "no shows." You get people who have no budget and no intent to buy.</p>

                <p>Start booking meetings that actually convert not ones that look great on a dashboard to your sales director.</p>

                <p>As we covered in <a href="/blog/stop-chasing-vanity-metrics/">Stop Chasing Vanity Metrics</a>, a full calendar is useless if it doesn't result in revenue.</p>

                <p>If you want to stop wasting time on bad meetings stop trying to force them.</p>

                <p>Focus on the problem. The meeting will follow.</p>
