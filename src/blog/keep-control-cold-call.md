<p>When cold calling it is so important to answer questions with a question.</p>
                
                <p>This does not mean avoiding the question. It just means that you keep control of the conversation.</p>
                
                <p>Most salespeople are polite. When they are asked a question they answer it immediately and then wait for the next instruction. This turns the salesperson into a servant rather than a peer.</p>
                
                <p>If you do not answer with a question two things will happen.</p>
                
                <p>First the prospect takes control of the call.<br>
                Second the conversation goes flat.</p>
                
                <p>You end up in an interrogation where they ask the questions and you give the answers until they eventually hang up.</p>

                <h2>The Art of the Reverse</h2>

                <p>In our <a href="/sdr-sales-training/">SDR Sales Training</a>, we teach reps that whoever is asking the questions is leading the dance.</p>
                
                <p>To stay in the lead you need to pivot their question back to them.</p>
                
                <p>Here are three real examples of how to do this in practice.</p>

                <h3>1. "Where are you calling from?"</h3>
                <p>This is often a smokescreen. They are trying to categorize you.</p>
                <p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> "I'm calling from ABC Company. You may not have heard of us. Now that you know where I am calling from is that a reason we should discontinue the conversation?"</p>
                <p>Notice the pivot. You answer the question but you immediately throw the ball back to check their intent.</p>

                <h3>2. "Where did you get my number from?"</h3>
                <p>This is a common objection in Australia. Salespeople panic here. They start apologizing. Instead use it to highlight your skill.</p>
                <p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> "I use a data provider. Are you worried or impressed that I broke through the noise?"</p>
                <p>This usually gets a laugh or at least a moment of respect.</p>

                <h3>3. "What makes you different from your competitor?"</h3>
                <p>If you answer this with a feature dump you lose. You do not know what they value yet.</p>
                <p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> "It is hard to answer that straight up. I would have to understand how and why you currently use our competitor. What is one thing you really like about working with them?"</p>

                <h2>Why This Is Hard</h2>

                <p>All three examples ensure the salesperson remains in control.</p>
                
                <p>This is much harder in practice than it looks on the page.</p>
                
                <p>Your brain is wired from a young age to answer questions. When a teacher or a parent asked you something you answered. It feels rude not to.</p>
                
                <p>But you have to remember that your prospect is wired the same way.</p>
                
                <p>If you ask them a question they feel a psychological need to answer it. This is how you open them up.</p>
                
                <p>We discuss the psychology behind these interactions in <a href="/blog/sales-excuses-translator/">The Sales Translator</a>. You need to understand that their question is rarely about the facts. It is about power.</p>

                <h2>Keep The Momentum</h2>

                <p>If you answer a question and stop talking the call dies.</p>
                
                <p>If you answer and ask another question the call moves forward.</p>
                
                <p>We proved this maintains engagement in our <a href="/blog/cold-calling-case-study/">Cold Calling Case Study</a>. The longer you control the flow the higher your conversion rate.</p>
                
                <p>Keep asking questions. Keep in control.</p>
                
                <p>Happy dialling.</p>
