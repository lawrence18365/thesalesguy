<p>If you are hiring a sales team in Sydney remember this golden rule.</p>

                <p>However your salesperson presents in the interview is exactly how they will sell to your customers.</p>

                <p>We often get blinded by the polish of a candidate. Most candidates will sit in your office and talk about the same things.</p>

                <p>They talk about their years of experience.<br>
                They talk about their industry knowledge.<br>
                They talk about their "little black book" of contacts.<br>
                They talk about how they once rescued a deal through "multi-threading."</p>

                <p>They sound good. They sound confident. So they are hired.</p>

                <p>But then the problems start.</p>

                <h2>The Mirror Effect</h2>

                <p>When they get in front of your prospects they talk the same talk. They treat the sales call exactly like they treated the job interview.</p>

                <p>"We have been doing this for 100 years."<br>
                "I have been in this industry for 10 years so you should trust me."<br>
                "I know a lot of people in this industry and I used to work with the same person you did."</p>

                <p>But none of that resonates with your prospect.</p>

                <p>As we discussed in <a href="/blog/stop-chasing-vanity-metrics/">Stop Chasing Vanity Metrics</a>, your prospect does not care about your history. They only care about their own problems.</p>

                <p>If your new hire spends the first ten minutes of a meeting talking about themselves they have already lost the room.</p>

                <h2>The "Covid Gym" Illusion</h2>

                <p>Your interview should never be about past experiences. Past performance is often just a result of a booming market.</p>

                <p>You could put a 16 year old behind a gym counter post-Covid and they would hit 300% of their target.</p>

                <p>Everyone wanted to join a gym. The "salesperson" was just taking orders. They still know nothing about sales.</p>

                <p>If you hire based on past numbers alone you are likely hiring an order taker. When the market gets tough, as we discussed in <a href="/blog/always-on-sales-myth/">The 'Always On' Sales Myth</a>, these people crumble because they do not know how to generate their own demand.</p>

                <h2>What You Should Ask Instead</h2>

                <p>Your interview should be entirely focused on your candidate's knowledge of the craft.</p>

                <p>You need to understand how they sell.</p>

                <p>Here are the questions I recommend asking to cut through the waffle.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>"How do people buy?"</strong><br>This tests if they understand psychology or if they just follow a script.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Can you walk me through your cold call?"</strong><br>Ask them how they would pitch your specific services. If they cannot structure a hook, they will fail. This is the first thing we cover in <a href="/sdr-sales-training/">SDR Sales Training</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Do you like to wing it?"</strong><br>Ask how they run a sales meeting or demo. If they say they "read the room" without a structure, that is a red flag.</li>
                    <li><strong>"How do you handle 'I need to think about it'?"</strong><br>This is the ultimate test. If they say they will send an email and follow up in a week, do not hire them. They should know how to uncover the real objection. We translate these objections in <a href="/blog/sales-excuses-translator/">The Sales Translator</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>"How many proposals do you send that don't close?"</strong><br>If they are sending proposals to everyone they are wasting your time. As we covered in <a href="/blog/death-of-sales-proposal/">The Death of the Sales Proposal</a>, a proposal should only be sent to confirm a deal that is already agreed upon.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Stop Recruiting on Waffle</h2>

                <p>Start understanding how your candidates sell and whether that fits what you need.</p>

                <p>If you need someone to actually sell and not just take orders then make sure they know how to actually do that.</p>

                <p>You can teach product knowledge. You can teach industry trends.</p>

                <p>But it is very expensive to hire someone who refuses to learn how to sell.</p>

                <p>Hire for skill. Not for tenure.</p>
