<p>I have been posting on here nearly every day for four months.</p>

                <p>I have been banging on about cold calling. It has got me thousands of new connections as well as a number of clients.</p>

                <p>But I have never really explained what I actually do.</p>

                <p>The LinkedIn gurus would be screaming at me for this. They say you should pitch in every post.</p>

                <p>So here it is.</p>

                <p>If you are looking for sales training in Sydney or across Australia, here is exactly how I help teams fix their outbound problems.</p>

                <h2>The Problem I Solve</h2>

                <p>I work with outbound sales teams that struggle to pick up the phone.</p>

                <p>The struggle usually comes down to two things: volume or quality.</p>

                <p>Usually it is both.</p>

                <p>They either make enough calls but burn through leads with a terrible pitch. Or they are too scared to dial so the volume is non-existent.</p>

                <p>We discuss the root cause of this fear in <a href="/blog/overcome-call-reluctance/">Overcome Call Reluctance</a>.</p>

                <h2>The Trial Workshop</h2>

                <p>I work with most of my clients on a trial basis.</p>

                <p>I run bespoke workshops based on their product. I look at their service. I look at their Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) and their industry.</p>

                <p>I do not believe in generic "off the shelf" training. Selling SaaS is different to selling recruitment.</p>

                <p>During these sessions I cover the fundamentals that actually convert.</p>

                <h3>1. What Cold Calling Isn't</h3>

                <p>We debunk the myths. We stop the "begging" mindset that we highlighted in <a href="/blog/stop-begging-for-meetings/">Stop Begging for Meetings</a>.</p>

                <h3>2. How to Introduce Yourself</h3>

                <p>The first seven seconds determine the success of the call.</p>

                <h3>3. Buyer Psychology</h3>

                <p>We look at how prospects actually make purchasing decisions. It is rarely about logic.</p>

                <h3>4. A Bespoke Framework</h3>

                <p>I build a custom framework that works with your specific buyer psychology. This is the core of our <a href="/sdr-sales-training/">SDR Sales Training</a>.</p>

                <h3>5. Questioning Strategies</h3>

                <p>We move away from scripts and towards conversations.</p>

                <h3>6. Understanding Objections</h3>

                <p>We teach why objections do not really exist and how to understand the truth behind them. This aligns with our work in <a href="/blog/sales-excuses-translator/">The Sales Translator</a>.</p>

                <h2>Implementation Is Key</h2>

                <p>At the end of these sessions the client and the salespeople decide if I am someone they can work with longer.</p>

                <p>If so we then look to implement.</p>

                <p>Training never works without follow-up. You can have a great workshop but if the team goes back to their desks and forgets it all on Monday morning it was a waste of money.</p>

                <p>We focus on long-term coaching to ensure the habits stick. This is a key part of our <a href="/account-executive-training/">Account Executive Training</a>.</p>

                <h2>Who I Work With</h2>

                <p>You might think cold calling only works for certain industries.</p>

                <p>You would be wrong.</p>

                <p>Within four months this approach has seen me work with clients in a wide range of sectors.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Hospitality SaaS.</li>
                    <li>HR SaaS.</li>
                    <li>Marketing Agencies.</li>
                    <li>Financial Services.</li>
                    <li>Recruitment.</li>
                    <li>IT Services.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The principles of human communication apply everywhere.</p>

                <p>If you run a sales team who struggle with picking up the phone then I might be able to help you too.</p>

                <p>Reach out. Let's fix your pipeline.</p>
