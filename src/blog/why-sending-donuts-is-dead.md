<p>I hate to say it but sending donuts (or any other baked goods) in the post is dead.</p>

                <p>We often look for "creative" ways to break through the noise. We want to avoid the phone so we convince ourselves that sending a gift is a better strategy.</p>

                <p>Last week I did not feel like prospecting over the phone. I fell into the trap we discuss in <a href="/blog/warm-call-delusion/">The 'Warm Call' Delusion</a>. I wanted to warm them up first.</p>

                <p>So I sent over donuts to a few prospects who had not been replying to my 28-step sequence.</p>

                <p>I thought it was a genius move.</p>

                <p>Then I got a reply from Debbie in HR at one of the companies.</p>

                <h2>The Krispy Kreme Disaster</h2>

                <p>Here is what she said.</p>

                <p><em>"Thank you for the random 6-pack of Krispy Kremes you sent over. Unfortunately Steve, our CEO, is a coeliac and could not enjoy the treats. Upon opening the box the flour from the donuts became airborne causing Steve to have an upset tummy for the rest of Wednesday."</em></p>

                <p>It gets worse.</p>

                <p><em>"The note on the donuts was clearly personalised by AI talking about his football team and where he went to school. It is a shame your new fancy AI tool could not pick up that Steve donates monthly to Coeliac Australia, the largest Coeliac charity in Australia."</em></p>

                <p>I tried to be clever and I ended up poisoning the CEO.</p>

                <h2>The Failure of Automated Research</h2>

                <p>This story highlights a massive problem in modern sales.</p>

                <p>We rely too heavily on tools to do our thinking for us. We trust the AI to write the note. We trust the "warm up" sequence to do the selling.</p>

                <p>But as Debbie pointed out my fancy tool missed a critical piece of information that a human would have found.</p>

                <p>In our <a href="/sdr-sales-training/">SDR Sales Training</a>, we teach reps that personalization requires actual effort. If you are just copy-pasting data from a tool you are going to get caught out.</p>

                <p>You might not physically harm your prospect like I did but you will damage your reputation.</p>

                <h2>The Safer Option</h2>

                <p>Debbie actually gave me some fantastic sales advice in her email.</p>

                <p><em>"I know you did not mean to do any harm but maybe think twice about who you send flour-based goods to. A better way to get his attention is to buy data off a data provider such as Apollo and cold call him."</em></p>

                <p>She is right.</p>

                <p>We spend so much time and money on gimmicks because we are afraid of the phone. We are afraid of rejection. We try to buy their affection with sugar.</p>

                <p>But as we proved in our <a href="/blog/cold-calling-case-study/">Cold Calling Case Study</a>, the direct approach is always the most respectful.</p>

                <h2>Cold Calling is Safe</h2>

                <p>There is a simple truth here.</p>

                <p>As we know no one ever died or got an allergic reaction from a cold call.</p>

                <p>The worst thing that happens on a cold call is they hang up. They do not get an upset tummy. You do not have to apologize to HR.</p>

                <p>If you are scared of the phone you are overthinking it. We break down these fears in <a href="/blog/overcome-call-reluctance/">Overcome Call Reluctance</a>.</p>

                <p>Stop hiding behind gifts. Stop hiding behind AI notes. Stop hiding behind 28-step email sequences.</p>

                <p>Just pick up the phone.</p>

                <p>It is safer for everyone.</p>
