<p>If you are wanting to start a business the best thing you can do is pick up the phone and start dialling.</p>
                
                <p>No one will give you the answers more than your target market.</p>
                
                <p>Far too many people worry about the wrong things. They obsess over their website. They agonize over their logo. They spend weeks designing a LinkedIn banner or setting up complex systems.</p>
                
                <p>Perfection comes later. Revenue comes first.</p>
                
                <p>When I first started out I had no offering other than the fact that I thought I could help companies sell better. I had spent years watching the mistakes many salespeople make as well as leading and selling myself.</p>
                
                <p>I did not hire a web developer. I picked up the phone.</p>

                <h2>The Market Will Tell You What to Sell</h2>

                <p>After a few weeks of calling I kept getting the same feedback.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "You are a fantastic cold caller."<br>
                    "I never stay on the phone to salespeople but you sound different."
                </blockquote>

                <p>I know that salespeople will do anything to not pick up the phone. We discuss this fear constantly in <a href="/blog/overcome-call-reluctance/">Overcome Call Reluctance</a>. I have been in companies where "sales" people have made no outbound calls ever.</p>

                <p>Then it hit me.</p>

                <p>I shouldn't just be doing sales. I should be teaching cold call training.</p>

                <p>My market gave me my product.</p>

                <h2>The First Deal</h2>

                <p>I went straight to the job board and typed in "SDR."</p>

                <p>I called the CEO of the first company that came up.</p>

                <p>I had no website.<br>
                I had no social proof.<br>
                I had no pricing structure.<br>
                I had no program.</p>

                <p>I kept the CEO on the phone for half an hour. He asked for a follow up in two months.</p>

                <p>Two months later a meeting was arranged. Within the meeting the sale was made.</p>

                <p>I did not need a brochure. I did not need a proposal. As we covered in <a href="/blog/death-of-sales-proposal/">The Death of the Sales Proposal</a>, if you can diagnose the problem and offer a solution you do not need paperwork to close the deal.</p>

                <h2>Cold Calling is Live Feedback</h2>

                <p>You don't need everything to be perfect before you start. I am still far off perfect and have so much I want to improve.</p>

                <p>But cold calling is so much more than just booking a meeting or making a sale.</p>

                <p>Every call is live feedback on your pitch and your service.</p>

                <p>If you are trying to launch a new product or service you can spend six months building it in isolation. Or you can spend six days calling people to see if they actually want it.</p>

                <p>We teach this validation process in our <a href="/sdr-sales-training/">SDR Sales Training</a>. You learn quickly what resonates and what falls flat.</p>

                <h2>Get On With It</h2>

                <p>If you want to launch a business stop hiding behind your laptop.</p>

                <p>Worry about the website later. Worry about the logo later.</p>

                <p>Pick up the phone and get on with it.</p>

                <p>If you can sell your vision to a stranger on a cold call you have a business. If you can't no amount of nice web design is going to save you.</p>
