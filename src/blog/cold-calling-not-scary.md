<p>Cold calling is not scary at all.</p>

                <p>Yet so many salespeople get the fear.</p>

                <p>They delay doing it.</p>

                <p>They make 10 dials a day and think that's good.</p>

                <p>They would rather send automated sequences out that don't even make sense but Chat GPT said it was good.</p>

                <p>But, why?</p>

                <p>It's because they're trying to sell to anyone that picks up. They're offering a meeting to anyone within 40 seconds just because they think they're in a rush.</p>

                <p>Cold calling isn't about selling to everyone.</p>

                <p>It's clearly explaining what you do, what you fix, and seeing if that exists in the prospects world.</p>

                <p>It's helping your prospects with problems that they had for years.</p>

                <p>Instead of "eugh, I have to cold call today."</p>

                <p>Or "eugh, I can't be bothered to interrupt people again"</p>

                <p>Change it.</p>

                <p>"I get to cold call today"</p>

                <p>"I get to help busy people with problems they could have had for ages"</p>

                <p>"They better be thankful I called them today"</p>

                <p>Your sales problems are down to one person. You, the salesperson.</p>

                <p>Change your attitude and watch the results change.</p>

                <p>And pick up the bloody phone.</p>
