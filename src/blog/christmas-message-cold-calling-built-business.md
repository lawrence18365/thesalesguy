<p>It is Christmas!</p>

                <p>And it is time for a break on the blog. No cold calling tips today. No advice. No rants.</p>

                <p>It has been three months since I started working for myself. And what a rollercoaster it has been.</p>

                <p>But despite the struggles and challenges it has been the most rewarding thing I have done in my career.</p>

                <h2>From Start-Up to Global Brands</h2>

                <p>I have had the opportunity to work with some amazing clients in this short time. They range from multi-national corporations to small start-ups who are trying outbound for the first time.</p>

                <p>When I decided I was to focus on teaching <a href="/sdr-sales-training/">Cold Call Training</a>, never did I imagine I would be working with global brands so quickly.</p>

                <p>But that is the power of the phone.</p>

                <p>It is amazing what a good cold call can do for your business.</p>

                <p>I did not wait for inbound leads. I did not wait for referrals. I picked up the phone and I called the people I wanted to work with. We detailed exactly how effective this approach is in our <a href="/blog/cold-calling-case-study/">Cold Calling Case Study</a>.</p>

                <h2>Going Global in 2026</h2>

                <p>Next year I will be starting with three new clients. I will be training teams in Europe, North America, Asia and of course back home here in Australia.</p>

                <p>This proves that the principles of human-to-human sales work everywhere.</p>

                <p>Whether you are in Sydney or Singapore people just want to be understood.</p>

                <p>If you have had an eye on my content and have been unsure about reaching out to someone who is so new to business then take a look at my track record. You can read more about my background on my <a href="/about/">About Page</a>.</p>

                <p>The results speak for themselves.</p>

                <h2>Thank You</h2>

                <p>But for now Merry Christmas everyone.</p>

                <p>And thanks once again to all those that have given me support over the last three months. I feel completely blessed.</p>

                <p>Enjoy the break. Rest up.</p>

                <p>Because in January we get back on the phones.</p>
