<p>"My team need to be better at handling objections. Can you help?"</p>

                <p>This was a question I was hit with in a recent sales training meeting.</p>

                <p>The above attitude is why most cold calls fall flat.</p>

                <p>Your job isn't to "handle" objections.</p>

                <p>It is to minimise them coming up whatsoever.</p>

                <h2>The Fight or Flight Response</h2>

                <p>Most objections are a reflex action. The prospect is in fight or flight mode.</p>

                <p>It happens because you make them feel uncomfortable.</p>

                <p>If you are getting hit with the same objections it is because of how you, the salesperson, are acting.</p>

                <p>It is not them. It is you.</p>

                <p>In our <a href="/sdr-sales-training/"><strong>SDR Sales Training</strong></a>, we teach that objections are usually a symptom of a bad start to the call.</p>

                <h2>The Root Cause of Objections</h2>

                <p>It is likely you are:</p>

                <p><strong>1. Introducing yourself like every other salesperson.</strong></p>
                <p>You sound like a telemarketer from 1999.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Talking at a million miles an hour.</strong></p>
                <p>You are nervous and it shows.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Talking at your prospect rather than engaging.</strong></p>
                <p>You are broadcasting instead of conversing.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Talking about features and benefits.</strong></p>
                <p>This is boring. They do not care about your product. They care about their problems.</p>

                <p><strong>5. Talking about yourself and your wonderful offering.</strong></p>
                <p>This is the vanity metrics trap we discuss in <a href="/blog/stop-chasing-vanity-metrics/"><strong>Stop Chasing Vanity Metrics</strong></a>.</p>

                <p><strong>6. Asking questions that only ever hit logic.</strong></p>
                <p>You fail to unlock the emotional driver.</p>

                <p><strong>7. You don't sound like you belong.</strong></p>
                <p>You lack the confidence of a peer.</p>

                <h2>Stop Looking for Hacks</h2>

                <p>Stop looking at cheap hacks to "handle objections."</p>

                <p>Start learning how to open up real business conversations.</p>

                <p>If you fix the opening the objections disappear.</p>

                <p>This is the focus of our <a href="/account-executive-training/"><strong>Account Executive Training</strong></a>. We teach reps to command the conversation from the first second so they never have to fight for attention later.</p>

                <p>If you are tired of battling objections stop creating them.</p>
