## 🎯 Internal Linking Best Practices

### 1. **Link Frequency**

**Good**:
- 2-5 internal links per 1,000 words
- 1-2 links in first 100 words (when natural)
- Related content links at article end

**Bad**:
- Over-linking (more than 8 per article)
- Stuffing keywords with links
- Linking same phrase multiple times

---

### 2. **Anchor Text Distribution**

**Ideal Mix** (for any given page):
- 40% Exact match ("SDR training")
- 30% Partial match ("professional SDR training")
- 20% Branded ("The Sales Guy's SDR training")
- 10% Generic ("click here", "learn more")

**Example for SDR page across 10 blog posts**:
- 4 posts: "SDR training"
- 3 posts: "cold calling training for SDRs"
- 2 posts: "The Sales Guy's SDR program"
- 1 post: "learn more about SDR training"

---

### 3. **Contextual Linking**

**Good Example**:
```
Many SDRs struggle with call reluctance. Professional
<a href="/sdr-sales-training/">cold calling training</a> helps teams
overcome phone anxiety and book 30% more meetings.
```
✅ Natural, contextual, adds value

**Bad Example**:
```
<a href="/sdr-sales-training/">SDR training</a> is important.
<a href="/sdr-sales-training/">Cold calling training</a> helps.
Get <a href="/sdr-sales-training/">SDR coaching</a> now.
```
❌ Spammy, forced, keyword stuffing

---

### 4. **Link Placement Priority**

**High Value** (link here first):
1. First paragraph (when natural)
2. Middle of article (contextual mention)
3. End of article ("Related: [link]")

**Medium Value**:
4. Sidebar (related posts widget)
5. Author bio

**Low Value**:
6. Footer navigation (still useful for UX)

---

### 5. **Conversion-Focused Linking**

**Article Structure**:
```
Introduction
  ↓
Problem discussion
  ↓
Solution (link to service page) ← HIGH VALUE
  ↓
Detailed explanation
  ↓
CTA (link to service page) ← HIGH VALUE
  ↓
Related content (link to other blog posts) ← MODERATE VALUE
```

**Example**:
```
[Opening paragraph about cold calling problems]

The solution? Structured <a href="/sdr-sales-training/">SDR training</a>
that addresses the psychology of cold calling.

[Explain the solution in detail]

Ready to transform your SDR team?
