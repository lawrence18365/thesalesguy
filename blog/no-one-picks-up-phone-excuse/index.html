                <p><strong>"No one picks up the phone anymore."</strong></p>
                
                <p>Let's be brutally honest—this is just one of those excuses that travel upwards through organisations like a bad smell. The SDR tells their team leader, who tells the director, who tells the CEO. Before you know it, everyone's convinced that <a href="/blog/is-cold-calling-dead-2026/">cold calling is dead</a> and inbound marketing is the only way forward.</p>
                
                <p>Except here's the uncomfortable truth: <strong>I book discovery calls via cold calls every single day.</strong> The same cold calls that "no one picks up."</p>
                
                <h2>The Irony of the Excuse</h2>
                
                <p>I've lost count of how many times prospects have told me "no one picks up the phone anymore"—while they're literally speaking to me on a call I booked via cold calling. The irony would be hilarious if it weren't so expensive for businesses buying into this myth.</p>
                
                <p>The reality? <strong>People absolutely pick up the phone.</strong> They just don't pick up when you're doing it wrong, or when you're not doing enough of it to get meaningful data.</p>
                
                <h2>The Real Problem: You're Not Making Enough Calls</h2>
                
                <p>When I ask sales teams how many calls they make per week, I typically hear one of two answers:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"We don't measure calls"</strong> — Translation: No one knows what works</li>
                    <li><strong>"About 30 a week"</strong> — That's 6 calls per day. Six.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Six calls per day is roughly 10 minutes of work. You can't build a pipeline on 10 minutes of prospecting. It's like going to the gym for 10 minutes and wondering why you're not getting results.</p>
                
                <p><a href="/blog/cold-call-training-sydney-how-i-help-sales-teams-win/">Top-performing SDRs</a> don't make 30 calls per week—they make 30 calls before lunch.</p>
                
                <h2>The Math That Matters: Cold Calling Statistics</h2>
                
                <p>Let me break down the actual numbers I see consistently across industries:</p>
                
                <h3>My Cold Calling Connect Rates:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1 in 8 calls</strong> results in someone picking up</li>
                    <li><strong>1 in 5 conversations</strong> results in a booked meeting</li>
                    <li>To book <strong>1 meeting per day</strong>, I need roughly 40 dials</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>That's not theory—that's the reality of <a href="/blog/cold-calling-benefits/">what actually works</a> when you stop making excuses and start making calls.</p>
                
                <p>If your team is making 30 calls per week (6 per day), you're averaging less than one actual conversation per day. Of course you're not booking meetings—you're barely visible to your prospects.</p>
                
                <h2>Why Gatekeepers Aren't the Problem Anymore</h2>
                
                <p>Here's something that might surprise you: <strong>you no longer have to go through gatekeepers.</strong> The old days of receptionists screening every call are largely over.</p>
                
                <p>Mobile numbers are readily available from dozens of data providers. LinkedIn Sales Navigator gives you direct access to decision-makers. Tools like Apollo, ZoomInfo, and Cognism have made it easier than ever to reach the person you actually need to speak with.</p>
                
                <p><a href="/blog/aim-high-cold-calling-strategy/">Aim high in your outreach</a>—skip the gatekeepers entirely and go straight to the decision maker.</p>
                
                <h2>The Only Metric That Actually Matters</h2>
                
                <p>Before every cold calling session, I set one target: <strong>conversations with decision makers.</strong> That's it. Not dials. Not talk time. Not even meetings booked (though that's what we're after).</p>
                
                <p>Why? Because conversations are the leading indicator of everything else. If I'm having quality conversations with the right people, meetings follow naturally. If I'm not having conversations, nothing else matters.</p>
                
                <p>Most sales teams obsess over activity metrics—calls made, emails sent, LinkedIn connections. But <a href="/blog/stop-chasing-vanity-metrics/">vanity metrics don't pay the bills</a>. Conversations do.</p>
                
                <h2>What 40 Dials Per Day Actually Looks Like</h2>
                
                <p>Let me paint you a picture of what a proper cold calling cadence looks like:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>8:30 AM:</strong> Start calling (catch people before meetings)</li>
                    <li><strong>10:00 AM:</strong> 20 dials completed, 2-3 conversations</li>
                    <li><strong>10:15 AM:</strong> Short break</li>
                    <li><strong>12:00 PM:</strong> 40 dials completed, 5 conversations, 1 meeting booked</li>
                    <li><strong>Repeat in the afternoon for meeting #2</strong></li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>That's it. Two hours of focused work, two meetings booked. Do that every day, and you're looking at 40+ qualified meetings per month. Most sales reps would kill for that pipeline.</p>
                
                <h2>Why People Actually Pick Up (And Stay On The Line)</h2>
                
                <p>When people tell me "no one picks up," what they're really saying is "no one picks up <em>for me</em>." There's a crucial difference.</p>
                
                <p>People pick up the phone when:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="/blog/keep-control-cold-call/">You sound confident and in control</a></li>
                    <li>You lead with value, not a product pitch</li>
                    <li>You've done your research on their business</li>
                    <li>You sound like a peer, not a salesperson begging for time</li>
                    <li><a href="/blog/overcoming-objections-cold-calling/">You handle objections smoothly</a></li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>When prospects do pick up, guess what? They're usually polite, engaged, and genuinely interested—if you've done your homework and approach the call correctly.</p>
                
                <h2>The Excuse Travelled Upward—Make Results Travel Upward Instead</h2>
                
                <p>That excuse about no one picking up? It started with one person who didn't want to make calls, and it infected the entire organisation. It's comfortable, it's convenient, and it's completely wrong.</p>
                
                <p>Want to know what travels upward even faster? Results.</p>
                
                <p>When an SDR books 10 meetings in a week through cold calling, suddenly everyone wants to know how they did it. When an AE closes a six-figure deal that started with a cold call, the "cold calling is dead" narrative evaporates.</p>
                
                <p><a href="/blog/how-to-start-a-business-cold-calling/">I built my entire business</a> on cold calling. Not inbound marketing. Not referrals. Cold calling. If no one picked up the phone, I'd be out of business.</p>
                
                <h2>How to Actually Put In The Effort</h2>
                
                <p>If you're serious about cold calling, here's what "actually putting in the effort" looks like:</p>
                
                <h3>1. Set Realistic Targets</h3>
                <p>Don't aim for "more calls." Aim for specific numbers: 40 dials per day, 5 conversations per day, 1 meeting per day minimum.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Track Everything</h3>
                <p>If you don't measure it, you can't improve it. Track dials, connects, conversations, meetings booked, and meetings held. Look for patterns in what works.</p>
                
                <h3>3. Get Quality Data</h3>
                <p><a href="/blog/cold-call-training-getting-a-meeting-wrong-goal/">Stop calling generic company numbers</a>. Invest in mobile data. Use tools like ZoomInfo, Apollo, or Cognism. Your connect rates will double immediately.</p>
                
                <h3>4. Practice Your Opener</h3>
                <p>The first 15 seconds determine whether they stay on the line. <a href="/blog/cold-call-training-5-minute-rule/">Practice until it's natural</a>, not robotic.</p>
                
                <h3>5. Call at the Right Times</h3>
                <p>Early mornings (8-9 AM) and late afternoons (4-5:30 PM) consistently outperform mid-day calling. Decision makers are in meetings 10 AM - 3 PM.</p>
                
                <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                
                <p>People do pick up the phone. They pick up every single day. The question isn't whether cold calling works—the question is whether <em>you're</em> willing to do what it takes to make it work.</p>
                
                <p>Stop eating up the excuses that travel upward through your organisation. Start creating results that travel upward instead.</p>
                
                <p>40 dials. 5 conversations. 1 meeting. Every single day. That's not impossible—that's Tuesday.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Get cold callin'.</strong></p>
